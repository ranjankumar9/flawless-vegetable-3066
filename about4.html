            <h2>Commitment to Farmers</h2>
            <p>Himalaya works one-on-one with farmers and through non-governmental organizations to help bring poorer farming communities a link to the marketplace. Through fair trade cooperative agreements, our goal is to help economically empower small and marginal farmers so they can further their livelihood.
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                Himalaya’s fair trade practices assure farmers are paid a minimum of 15-20% higher than the actual cost of cultivation. In addition to favorable wages, other benefits to the farmers include an assured market for their crops, an assured price and income (we protect them from the ups and downs of the market), and the costs for their required certifications, packaging and transportation are borne by us, not them.</p>

            <h2>Partnership with Vitamin Angels</h2>
            <p>Himalaya continues to be a proud supporter of Vitamin Angels, a worldwide non-profit organization helping to save the lives and eyesight of nutrient deficient children. Vitamin Angels reduces child mortality by connecting infants and children under five with vital nutrients.
                <br><br>
                It only takes 50¢ to reach one child twice a year with enough vitamin A to reduce childhood mortality by 24% and ensure a child's eyesight. Vitamin Angels gives children a chance for a brighter future, and Himalaya is proud to be an ongoing supporter of their work.</p>

            <h2>Trees for Life</h2>
            <p>Himalaya has been planting trees in the Western Ghats of India since 2011. The Western Ghats is identified as a biodiversity hotspot by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
                <br><br>
                To date, we have planted 750,000 trees, covering 900 acres in partnership with a local non-government organization, the Society for Environment and Biodiversity Conservation. Himalaya supports the planting of a mix of fruit, fodder, endemic, medicinal and other trees that support the local ecology and biodiversity.
                <br><br>
                Some of the medicinal trees planted include Ashwagandha, Arjuna, Amla and Hirada. The program also supports the planting of fruit trees such as mango, papaya, banana and cashew nut, which generate income to local farmers in the program and serve as supplementary nutrition. In addition, we have also planted Abutilon ranadei, a native plant that is critically endangered.

            <h2>Certification for Environmental Management</h2>
            <p>Himalaya has taken several steps to conserve water, power and reduce pollution to meet National Quality Assurance (NQA) guidelines. The most significant achievement has been setting up a water treatment plant and sourcing water with low Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) externally. This has reduced Himalaya’s water consumption by as much as 10,000 liters a day.
                <br><br>
                Himalaya has been awarded ISO-14001:2004 certification, the most recognized standard globally, for environment management. The certification is granted by National Quality Assurance (NQA), the UK's largest established certification body.</p>
